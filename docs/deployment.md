# Deploying PiSphere

Deploying PiSphere involves setting up a node or deploying a decentralized application (dApp) on the PiSphere ecosystem. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying PiSphere.

## Setting up a Node

To set up a node, follow these steps:

1. Install the PiSphere software on your computer or server.
2. Configure the node to connect to the PiSphere network.
3. Start the node and begin validating transactions and blocks.

## Deploying a dApp

To deploy a dApp, follow these steps:

1. Develop your dApp using Solidity and the PiSphere smart contract platform.
2. Compile and deploy your dApp to the PiSphere blockchain.
3. Configure your dApp to interact with the PiSphere ecosystem.

## Node Configuration

The following configuration options are available for nodes:

* **Node type**: Choose from a variety of node types, including full nodes, light nodes, and validator nodes.
* **Network configuration**: Configure the node to connect to the PiSphere network, including setting the node's IP address and port.
* **Blockchain configuration**: Configure the node's blockchain settings, including the block size and block time.

## dApp Configuration

The following configuration options are available for dApps:

* **Smart contract configuration**: Configure the smart contract settings, including the contract address and ABI.
* **Frontend configuration**: Configure the frontend settings, including the user interface and user experience.
* **Backend configuration**: Configure the backend settings, including the API and database connections.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment, refer to the PiSphere troubleshooting guide for assistance.
